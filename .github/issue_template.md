## Expected behavior


## Actual behavior from `emacs-helm.sh` if possible (See note at bottom)


## Steps to reproduce (recipe)


## Backtraces if some (M-x toggle-debug-on-error)


## Describe versions of helm, emacs, operating system etc.


## IMPORTANT NOTE:

Helm is providing a script named `emacs-helm.sh` which allows running Helm
in a neutral environment with only helm installed with minimal settings.
When possible it is important to use it to reproduce your helm bugs 
to ensure no other package is interfering.
To run it, just cd to the directory where helm is installed and call ./emacs-helm.sh.

Thanks.
